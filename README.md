1 – For a given undirected graph G(V, E), with n vertices and m edges, does G have a clique with k
vertices? A clique of G is a subset of vertices, all adjacent to each other, i.e., defining a complete
subgraph of G. Example: in a social network, a clique is a subset of people who all know each otherer
